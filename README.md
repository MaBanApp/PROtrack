# PROtrack iOS-App

This is the iOS-App for our Project at Juventus Schulen

## Dependencies

In order to use this App, you need to get the API from my colleague:
```
https://github.com/glichfalls/pro-track-api
```

## Security

Due to time pressure, we dont focus on security in the first place. (at least for now)


## Progress

The Project is done, at least for now. There is still a lot to do for Bugfixing and Code-cleaning but the time for our project is over.
